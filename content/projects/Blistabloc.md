Currently advancing my UX/UI design skills through Googleâ€™s certification
program, covering end-to-end design processes from user research to high-fidelity
prototypes.

This structured learning experience is transforming how I conceptualize user
needs before jumping to solutions, ensuring my designs are both intentional and impactful.
